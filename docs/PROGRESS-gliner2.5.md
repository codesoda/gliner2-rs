# GLiNER2.5 progress

The active goal is **not complete**. See `AUDIT-gliner2.5.md` for the full
prompt-to-evidence checklist. Model-free test success is not model parity.

## Phase A — plan approved; M0 implementation underway

### Done

- Recovered the requested prompt and its three companion research documents
  from the sibling research worktree; the task branch previously lacked docs/.
- Read current Rust pipeline, embeddings/schema/tokenization/decoding/adapters,
  exporter/validator scripts and context documents.
- Cloned upstream and pinned `d7c727458bf6929bc9ef5ee04e13c3f717a7c455`.
  Astra reviewed real boundary, processor, runtime and decoder source.
- Retrieved immutable small/base/multi model revisions and committed their
  actual configs. Compared encoder dimensions and safetensors headers.
- Authored `PLAN-gliner2.5.md` before implementation, including source-derived
  corrections: extra explicit sparse scorer, stable shared-pool sort, record
  legacy semantics, choice-prefix truncation, whitespace default for multi,
  directional relations and byte-offset policy.
- Started Sol M0 implementation against the full approved plan; no boundary
  inference support is being represented as finished at the scaffold stage.

### Measured

- Baseline no-model `cargo test`: passes with model tests skipped.
- Baseline strict Clippy: 10 pre-existing library diagnostics; fix mechanically
  in M0 without changing public APIs or v2 outputs.
- Baseline archived at `2883a73`: existing tests with actual v2 model artifacts
  and pinned tokenizer all pass with **zero SKIP messages**.
- Captured four representative pre-change v2 outputs (including Unicode and
  combined classification/entities) for byte-for-byte M0 comparison.
- All three boundary_head configs are identical. Small hidden width384;
  base/multi768. All actual checkpoint tensor dtypes F32. Verified classifier
  keys `.0` and `.3`; encoder configs' float16 metadata is not authoritative.
- Existing public ONNX repository lacks tokenizer/config files; fresh-consumer
  validation must not rely on developer-local metadata.

### Next

- Finish/review M0: architecture dispatch + compatibility aliases, synchronized
  token/offset truncation before choice prefix, extraction query enumeration,
  consistent test fixture paths/strict model tests, lint and formatting hygiene.
- Run all M0 gates; compare baseline snapshot and audit actual code before commit.
- M1 then pins a uv Python environment and generates real stage-wise goldens.
  No export success or parity is claimed yet.

### Open questions / gates

- Exact floating-point compatibility parity across torch and Rust needs
  measurement; Astra has approved **no** tolerance or pool-order exception.
- Exporter dependency compatibility (upstream declares transformers<5 despite
  checkpoint metadata5.8.0), finite-mask attention lowering and long-sequence
  memory require actual experiments in M1/M2.
- HF publication credentials have not been checked. Ask for input if absent
  before the M7 upload; GitHub authentication is available.
- Optional M8 helpers are not implemented or advertised. Public explicit-span
  primitive remains in required deliverables because downstream use needs it.
